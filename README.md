## Select a project methodology

The success of any project, from the simplest problem-solving exercises to the most complex endeavours, is underpinned by the methods used in carrying it out. For this reason, project management has emerged as an up and coming high demand work industry. The most successful teams and businesses value project management and methodology considerations as an unmissable first step to any project undertaking.

Software engineering and data science projects are usually fairly complex and often involve lots of moving parts and dozens of team members all working towards one shared goal. In order to best align these stakeholders, an appropriate project methodology must be chosen and subsequently followed by everyone involved. And in order to do that, the team's project manager (usually someone who has expert knowledge of the target domain, as well as project management experience) must analyse and carefully consider a project's requirements against the strengths of a number of existing project methodologies.

For this project, our team will be working with a dataset from the BFI, to answer the following question: ...

The **Data-driven Scrum** method (an agile framework optimised for data science teams which integrates elements of Scrum and Kanban) stands out as the most suitable methodology for the project at hand. Given my experience using Scrum in numerous projects undertaken during internships and summer work in the past, I'm highly familiar with the way it works and felt that it permits the iteration and flexibility this project might need due to its short timeframe and its inherent volatility (due to the ever-changing climate of the film industry). The Data-driven Scrum method permits all the benefits of the traditional Scrum method, but with some added functionality:

1. Variable length duration: allows more flexibility for teams who mispredict the duration of certain tasks. The traditional Scrum method has fixed sprint lengths
2. Reviews on an As and When: project retrospectives and item reviews happen as frequently as the team would like, as opposed to happening at the end of each iteration like in traditional Scrum
3. Collective analysis: the entire project team contributes to any hypothesis analysis efforts - the onus doesn't fall solely on the product owner to analyse ideas which means this analysis can benefit from team members' aggregate technical expertise.
