### Report 1

**List what you completed or made progress on this week (in the coursework project).**

I've made a shortlist of project methodologies and will have selected an appropriate methodology for my project by the end of the day.

**List what you plan to do next week (for the coursework project)**

Next week, I plan on having comprehensively defined the problem my project aims to solve, by gaining a thorough understanding of the business needs that underpin my project.

**Briefly describe any issues that are impeding your progress (in the coursework project).**

So far, none. Just hoping to define the problem more.

### Report 2

**List what you completed or made progress on this week (in the coursework project).**

This week I was able to make some progress on defining the problem I intend on solving in my project, by exploring my dataset further and carrying out some research to bolster my understanding of the business/stakeholders and industries which relate to my data.

**List what you plan to do next week (for the coursework project):**

I plan to further explore the problem I aim to tackle in this project, by more clearly defining the problem statement, user stories and personas, to facilitate my focus and understanding of the problem at hand while I go onto the next stage of data preparation and exploration.

**Briefly describe any issues that are impeding your progress (in the coursework project).**

Some personal circumstances, including a COVID scare and family commitments, have meant that I've struggled with balancing my project/university work and my personal life. I expect that this will not be the case next week, and I intend on working hard over the next 4 days to catch myself up on the work I haven't been able to do.
